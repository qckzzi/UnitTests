# UnitTests

**Unit tests in a mock Django REST project.**

In this project, I created a simple Django REST project to practice with unit tests.

I also studied the Coverage library for myself, which visualizes the measure of code coverage with tests.

All tests are in **UnitTests/DjangoRestProj/app/exchange_app/tests/**

The dependency version file is stored in **UnitTests/DjangoRestProj/requirements.txt**

**IDE:** PyCharm Professional

**DBMS (СУБД):** SQLite

**Frameworks:** Django 4.1.6, Django REST Framework 3.14.0

**Python interpreter version:** 3.11
